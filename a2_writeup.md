# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
Understanding what thought process would lead to the correct answers in the percent section was the most difficult for me. I wasn't thinking about the problem as a whole and was instead thinking about each case individually. That failed pretty hard for me.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You can swap the underscores for a single word string and the percent signs for multi word strings. You can then use a pattern that the input should match with and print results accordingly.
